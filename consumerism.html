  <p>Sometimes the God's of America forcefully possess my body and after breaking out of the induced fugue state I find myself with new products. </p>
  <p>In order to make the most of this situation I have decided to review these purchases in order to meditate on if they add any real value to my life. </p>

    <h3>Innioasis Y1 <img src="assets/star.gif" class="inline-gif"></h3>
    <p>A couple moonths ago I bought my GF and I ipod nanos, loaded custom firmware on them (rockbox), then "found" some flac files to load on them of some of our favorite songs.
       I had never worked with flac files before and underestimated the size of them. The 8gh nanos fit aout 11 flac ablums which for me wasn't enough. I liked the old ipods for 
       the ability to disconnect from my phone in the gym. As far as flac files go I want to explore more high quality audio. When my friend I listened 
       to the flac version of MF DOOM's Meatgrinder we noted the blunt hit before the verses start was crisper, who would want to give that up? </p>
    <p>The Innioasis Y1 solves these problems while looking like an old ipod classic. It supports flac files right out of the box and 64gb onlys costs $50 nearly the same as the nano.
        My only complaint is the build quality feels signifigantly cheaper than a ipod classic mostly due to how light it is compared to the legend that inspired it. That said, usb c
        charging, flac support right out the box, bluetooth, and the working scroll wheel are really strong features at this price point. A comparable modded ipod classic requires some
        advanced tinkering to mod it to this level of capability and would cost you up to $400 to bring it up to 2026 spec. </p>
    <p>Overall I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it for someone wanting to decentralize their phone. I will say I totally jumped the gun on this and definitely had some
        "post purchase quality" realizing my music collection needs a signifigant expansion to jusitify this purchase. It will catch up, right?  </p>
